### Why
Programming with no goal, thought about making an program to state questions (situations) and options to adress those like an notepad, but "funnier". It was a cool, but as I began I tought that making a geogebra in the console would be even better. In python just because it is easy, and I was playing around with the interactive shell

### Runnning

### Dev rules
```
1 - DO NOT use any LIBRARY 
2 - it HAS to be CONCISE
3 - CLEAN instead of short
4 - MINIMAL functions and classes sizes
5 - STRAIGHTFORWARD use
6 - CLEAN code does not need comments
```

(note: focusing in plotter.py from now on, I will implement all todos and improve the overall code quality of plotter)
