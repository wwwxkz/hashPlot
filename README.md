### Programming with no goal, thought about making an program to
### state questions (situations) and options to adress those like
### like an notepad, but "funnier"

### It was a cool, but as I began I tought that making a geogebra
### in the console would be even better

### In python just because it is easy, and I was playing around with
### the interactive shell
